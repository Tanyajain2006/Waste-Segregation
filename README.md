# ♻️ Waste Segregation using Machine Learning

## 🌍 Overview
This project aims to automate **waste classification** using **machine learning** techniques to promote sustainable waste management.  
The system can classify different types of waste into categories such as **Paper, Plastic, Metal, Glass, Cardboard, Organic Waste, Aluminium Cans, E-waste, Industrial Waste**, and **Hospital Waste**.

By integrating AI into waste management, this project contributes to a cleaner environment and helps optimize recycling processes.
